# Cover Letter - Tata Global Internships

**Subject:** Application for Tata Global Internships Progam 2025 – Omi Chauhan

**To the Hiring Committee,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Tata Global Internships program. As a pre-final year B.Tech student in Metallurgy and Material Sciences at NIT Warangal, bridging the gap between core engineering processes and advanced data analytics has been the defining theme of my academic journey. I am captivated by Tata Group’s legacy of innovation across diverse sectors—from automotive to finance—and I am eager to contribute my skills in quantitative analysis and full-stack development to solve real-world business challenges.

The Tata Global Internship’s focus on immersive, live business projects is exactly the environment I am seeking. My technical background is grounded in a "learning agility" that allows me to adapt quickly to new domains. For instance, during my internship at Rajputana Vehicles Pvt. Ltd., I didn't just analyze data; I built KPI dashboards and used K-Means clustering to fundamentally improve how the company understood regional vehicle demand. This experience taught me that data is only as valuable as the strategic decisions it enables.

My portfolio includes two major projects that align directly with Tata’s key business verticals:

1.  **Automotive & Tech (AutoSight SaaS):** I successfully built a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for automotive market analysis. Using FastAPI, Redis, and React, I created a system that leverages AI to forecast demand. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable software solutions that can drive efficiency in the automotive sector, a core pillar of the Tata Group.
2.  **Finance (Credit Risk Intelligence):** With a deep interest in quantitative finance, I developed a machine learning model to predict loan defaults. By utilizing logistic regression and rigorous statistical analysis, I aimed to reduce false positives in credit scoring—a critical challenge for financial institutions like Tata Capital.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate with a global cohort of peers and industry leaders. I believe my unique blend of material sciences engineering, software development, and financial modeling will allow me to bring a fresh, multi-disciplinary perspective to the internship projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and enthusiasm for solving complex problems can contribute to the success of the Tata Global Internships program.

Sincerely,

**Omi Chauhan**
